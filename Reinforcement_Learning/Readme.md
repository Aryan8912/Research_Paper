# Basics of Reinforcement Learning

 Reinforcement learning problems involve learning what to do how to map situations to actions so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. In an essential way they are closed-loop problems because the learning systems actions inuence its later inputs.

 Elements of Reinforcement Learning:  four main subelements of a reinforcement learning system: a *policy*, a *reward signal*, a *value function*, and, optionally, a *model of the environment*
