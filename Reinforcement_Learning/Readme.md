# Basics of Reinforcement Learning

 Reinforcement learning problems involve learning what to do, how to map situations to actions to maximize a numerical reward signal. Essentially they are closed-loop problems because the learning system's actions influence its later inputs.

 Elements of Reinforcement Learning:  four main subelements of a reinforcement learning system: a `policy`, a `reward signal`, a `value function`, and, optionally, a `model of the environment`
